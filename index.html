    <p>Brownie is the name of my pet dog. He has long, drooping ears with a mix of white, black and brown fur on his body. He is of Beagle breed. We adopted him from a dog care centre in our neighbourhood when he was just a month old. He has a cute face with little paws and eyes and has a tiny tail. He is a healthy dog with a shiny coat.

        Brownie runs very fast with his four tiny legs. He watches our house at night. In case of any noise, he barks out loudly. Although he barks at strangers, he never bites them. He loves eating vegetables and I sometimes offer him meat and fish to eat. I bathe him once every few days and play with him in the garden to ensure he is exposed to sunlight and fresh air every day.
        
        My pet, Brownie is close to me and I love him very much. He cheers me up whenever I’m upset and we go for a walk every morning. He wags his tail with joy when I return from school. I take him to the veterinary doctor occasionally for vaccination. He is not just my pet dog, but my best friend too. He is indeed a blessing in my life.”
        
        Dogs are indeed very intelligent and responsive pets who protect us from external dangers

        She likes to use my ankle as a chin rest.
She is fond of nectarines.
She smiles. She really does.
An empty yogurt container can entertain her for the better part of an afternoon.
She has no problem with sleeping in.
She responds to several nicknames including Carlie, Noodle, Noosie, Noo-del, Rosemarino, Carleen, Carlata, Shamu and, occasionally, Le Pamplemouse.
Before I met her, her personality was described to me as ambitious, and this truly fits her.
She is very busy.
She is the most curious dog I have ever met.
If I am at my desk for more than three hours in a row, she will go to the bathroom door (the farthest she can get from my desk and still be in my apartment), take a running start and hurl herself into my chair legs, repeatedly, until I leave my desk.
She snorts.
When she wants attention, she does what I call the chomp-chomp. She bites at the air, twice, with an additional burst of growl.
She loves my dad.
When she is pleased she will slide one side of her face across the floor, tail in the air, while grunting.
Did I mention she likes to use my ankle as a chin rest?
She taught me squirrel is a verb.
Carlie’s coat is supposed to be straight, but hers has a curl to it.
With new people, she keeps it close to the vest.
She is not wild about little children, but she is kind to them.
About two weeks after I brought her home, Carlie and I were walking on Lexington Avenue. A woman, who was by my estimate well into her eighties, stopped me and said, “I had a Westie.”  I smiled. Her eyes filled up with tears and she told me, “She was the love of my life!” Now that I know Carlie, I can understand how that would be true.
